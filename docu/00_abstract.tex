\chapter*{Abstract}
The content of this paper is splitted into three parts, it begins with an overview
of data streams and their difficulties, followed by a part about Apache Storm
a distributed stream processing framework. And finally a concrete implemen-
tation based on a given problem, solved with Apache Storm. The goal of the
implementation is to analyze the minutely updated Augmented Diffs of Open-
StreetMap and do a benchmark to test the performance of Apache Storm.
