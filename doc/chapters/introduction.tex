Durring the Master of Science in Engineering the students have to participate at two seminars.
The goal of these is to elaborate a theme on their own, discuss the result in group and write a paper about the topic.

The Databasesystems Seminar does a focus on GPU Database Systems.
The students do have a closer look at a certain GPU Database product and have to do a benchmark.

The benchmark is based on the public NYC Taxi Rides dataset and the queries are predetermined by Prof. Stefan Keller.
